# Smart Contract Lottery - Powered by Foundry

## What is this project about?

- This project is about creating a decentralized lottery system using blockchain technology. The system allows users to participate in an online Raffle and picks a winner among the users and then pays out the winner. The winner is picked in a provably random manner using Chainlink's VRF function

- Some constraints
  a. No actual users involved. Most likely it will be dummy accounts sending fake eth into the smart contract
  b. It's not production scale
